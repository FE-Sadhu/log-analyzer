Just four things u need to know 👻

👉🏿 If u wanna consult some configs (like `ESLint`, `Prettier` ...) that you should do well when init the project, plz switch to branch `main`.

✌🏽 If u wanna consult perfect configs with `webpack`,`babel`,`react`,`typescript`, check out the branch `configure_webpack`.

🤟 I guess u will look up this repo time and again, welcome to `star` and `fork` :)

🖖🏼 If some dependencies are upgraded, I'd like to embrace changes. So, u can `watch` this repo to get latest version.

happy hacking 🎉
